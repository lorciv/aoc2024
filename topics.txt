DAY	DIFFICULTY	TOPICS
===	==========	======
3	?			regular expressions
4	?			grids of characters, move around, look-up
5	easy		iterate, swap
6	hard		like day 4, but more complex
7	medium		permutations (with repetition)
				recursive algorithm is simple, but slow (exponentially)
8	easy		grid, look around, some geometry
9	medium		move around segments in array
10	medium		grid, explore paths, breadth-first search
				part 1: simple search
				part 2: find all paths
11	hard		part 1: brute force
				part 2: recursion and memoization
