DAY	DIFFICULTY	TOPICS
===	==========	======
3	?			regular expressions
4	?			grids of characters, move around, look-up
5	easy		iterate, swap
6	hard		like day 4, but more complex
7	medium		permutations (with repetition)
				recursive algorithm is simple, but slow (exponentially)
8	easy		grid, look around, some geometry
